# Self-driving car behavioural cloning

Basic boiler-plate code for the model training and driving.

Achieves MSE on validation of 0.010 after 5 training epochs.  Model can drive part way round the track, but drives too
close to the edge of the road and is unable to recover when it gets stuck at the side of the road.
